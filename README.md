# Todo CLI

## Overview

Welcome to Todo CLI, your efficient command-line task manager designed to streamline productivity and organization directly from your terminal. This application offers a seamless experience for creating multiple todo lists, managing tasks with flexible commands, and maintaining organized workflows without leaving the command line environment.

This project was developed with Node.js, SQLite, and modern CLI libraries, focusing on providing an intuitive interface for task management with persistent data storage. Whether you're managing daily tasks, project milestones, shopping lists, or work assignments, Todo CLI ensures efficient task tracking with elegant terminal interactions and reliable data persistence.
